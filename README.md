## Impensa is an open-source expense management app

- See where all your money goes by easily adding and categorizing new expenses
- Analyze your expenditure using data visualization tools
- Export .xlsx report with all your expenses

## What's cool about this?

Impensa is an open-source project, meaning you can easily access needed app functional and modify lines of code.

We are an open-source alternative to products such as Mint, Simplifi or PocketGuard. Although the functionality of the app is not as advanced, we're designed to be more developer-friendly.

## Features

## Technologies

Let's talk about the architecture of this mono repo:

- **Full-stack JavaScript**: We use Node.js to power our servers, and React to power our frontend. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be JavaScript.
- Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:
  - **PostgreSQL 16**: Object-relational database
  - **.Net 8**: Our backend framework of choice
  - **React 18**: Frontend framework
  - **Docker**: To deploy our app in a neat container

## Deployment

We support deploying the application using docker.
You will need to clone both the client and the server repositories.
Docker image will need to be built locally with `sudo docker build -t impensa-server-dotnet:latest .`.
After that you can use the provided docker-compose file to run the application.
It is recommended to use a reverse proxy in front of the application.

This is the recommended project structure:

```plaintext
impensa
â”œâ”€â”€ client
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â””â”€â”€ server-dotnet
```

## Code Style

We run Prettier on-commit, which means you can write code in whatever style you want and it will be automatically formatted according to the common style when you run `git commit`. We also have ESLint set up, although we've disabled all stylistic rules since Prettier takes care of those.
