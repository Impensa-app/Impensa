## Impensa is an open-source expense managment app
* Add, delete or modify expenses
* View your expenditure using data visualization tools
* Export .xlsx report with all your expenses


## What's cool about this?

Impensa is an open-source project, meaning you can easily access needed app functional and modify needed lines of code.

We are an open-source alternative to products such as Mint, Simplifi or PocketGuard. Although the functionality of the app is not as advanced, we're designed to be more developer-friendly.

It's been made with love.
